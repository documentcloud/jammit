    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Grab the gem:<br />
        <tt>gem install jammit</tt>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the gem to Rails' <b>environment.rb</b> inside of the initializer:<br />
        <tt>config.gem "jammit"</tt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you're using <b>Rails 3</b>, you're done! Jammit routes 
          (under <b>/assets</b> by default) will be loaded automatically into 
          your app.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're using <b>Rails 2</b>, edit <b>config/routes.rb</b> to give 
          Jammit routes for dynamic asset packaging and caching.
        </p>
<pre>
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  ...
  Jammit::Routes.draw(map)
  ...
end</pre>

      weigh in at 5 megabytes.</i>
    </p>

    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

    <p>
      Jammit uses the <b>config/assets.yml</b> YAML configuration file to define
      packages and to set extra options. A package is an ordered set of directory glob
      rules that will be expanded into a unique list of files. An example of
      a complete <b>assets.yml</b> follows:
    </p>

<pre>
embed_assets: on

javascripts:
  workspace:
    - public/javascripts/vendor/jquery.js
    - public/javascripts/lib/*.js
    - public/javascripts/views/**/*.js
    - app/views/workspace/*.jst

stylesheets:
  common:
    - public/stylesheets/reset.css
    - public/stylesheets/widgets/*.css
  workspace:
    - public/stylesheets/pages/workspace.css
  empty:
    - public/stylesheets/pages/empty.css</pre>

    <p>
      There are a number of extra configuration options that you may add to the
      <b>assets.yml</b> configuration file to customize the way Jammit behaves.
      Here's an <a href="https://gist.github.com/667693">example configuration file</a>
      using all of the possible options. The meaning of the options and their
      default values are listed below. Don't be bewildered by the length of the
      list &mdash; none of the options are required, they just give you fine-grained
      control over how your packages are generated.

      The contents of <tt>assets.yml</tt> are passed through <b>ERB</b> before

      <i>Warning: In <b>Rails 3</b>, static assets are not served by default.
      You either have to configure your webserver to serve static assets out
      of</i> <tt>public</tt> <i>(recommended), or set</i>
      <tt>config.serve_static_assets = true</tt>
    </p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

    <p>
      To access your packages in views, use the corresponding helper. The
      helper methods can include multiple packages at once:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;%= include_stylesheets :common, :workspace, :media => 'all' %&gt;
&lt;%= include_javascripts :workspace %&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      In development, no packaging is performed, so you'll see a list of individual
      references to all of the JavaScript and CSS files. The <b>assets.yml</b>
      configuration file is reloaded on every development request, so you can
      change the contents of your packages without needing to restart Rails.
      In all other environments, or if <b>package_assets</b> is set to "<b>always</b>",
      you'll get tags for the merged packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If <b>allow_debugging</b> is left on, you'll be able to request the development
      version of the assets for any given page, by passing <tt>debug_assets=true</tt>
      as a query parameter.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can easily use Jammit within your Rakefile, and other scripts:
    </p>

    <pre>require 'jammit'
Jammit.package!</pre>

    <h2 id="compressors">YUI, Closure &amp; UglifyJS</h2>

    <p>
      Jammit can be configured to use the
      <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI Compressor</a>, the
      <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google Closure Compiler</a>, or
      <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/">UglifyJS</a>
      to compress and optimize your JavaScript. (CSS is always run through the
      YUI Compressor.) Specify the <b>javascript_compressor</b> to choose either <b>yui</b>,
      <b>closure</b>, or <b>uglifier</b> backends. If left blank, Jammit defaults to <b>yui</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure the JavaScript compilation by adding <b>compressor_options</b>
      to your <b>assets.yml</b>. The <b>compressor_options</b>
      will be passed directly to the Gem backend of your chosen compressor. See the
      <a href="http://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-yui-compressor">ruby-yui-compressor</a>,
      <a href="http://github.com/documentcloud/closure-compiler">closure-compiler</a>, or
      <a href="https://github.com/lautis/uglifier">uglifier</a>
      gem documentation for all the available options. For example, to configure
      the Closure Compiler to use its
      <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels.html">advanced optimizations</a>,
      you would add the <b>compilation_level</b>:
    </p>

<pre>
javascript_compressor: closure
compressor_options:
  compilation_level: "ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS"
</pre>

    <p>
      Jammit always uses the YUI CSS Compressor to compress CSS files. You can
      <a href="http://yui.rubyforge.org/classes/YUI/CssCompressor.html">configure it</a>
      by specifying the <b>css_compressor_options</b>, in <b>assets.yml</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        <b>Warning:</b> Google's Closure Compiler has been known to choke on certain
        already pre-compressed JavaScripts, such as the production version of jQuery.
        Using the uncompressed development version is recommended.
      </i>
    </p>

    <h2 id="precaching">Precaching Assets</h2>

    <p>
      Installing the Jammit gem provides the optional but handy <tt>jammit</tt> command-line utility,
      which can be hooked into your deployment process. The <tt>jammit</tt>
      command reads in your configuration file, generates all of the defined
      packages, and gzips them at the highest compression setting. In order to
      serve these static gzipped versions, configure your <b>Nginx</b>
      <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpGzipStaticModule">http_gzip_static_module</a>,
      or your <b>Apache</b>
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/content-negotiation.html">Content Negotiation MultiViews</a>.
      It's also a good idea to have gzip compression turned on for the remainder
      of your static assets, including any asset packages that aren't gzipped-in-advance.
      Adding <b>Nginx</b>'s
      <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpGzipModule">http_gzip_module</a>
      or <b>Apache</b>'s
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html">mod_deflate</a>
      will do the trick.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>jammit</tt> command can be passed options to configure the
      path to <b>assets.yml</b>, and the output directory in which all packages
      are compiled. Run <tt>jammit --help</tt> to see all of the options. For
      speedy builds, <tt>jammit</tt> will check the modification times of your packages
      and source files: only the packages that have changed are rebuilt. If you'd
      like to force all packages to build, use <tt>jammit --force</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In production, you'll want to run Jammit during deployment, somewhere
      in between updating the source and symlinking to the new release. Whether you're
      using <a href="http://www.capify.org/index.php/Capistrano">Capistrano</a>,
      <a href="http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html">Vlad</a>,
      or just good 'ol <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>,
      it shouldn't be too hard to add a step that calls the <tt>jammit</tt> command.
    </p>

    <h2 id="expires">Expires Headers</h2>

    <p>
      To get the fastest page load times for your regular visitors, it's recommended
      to set the HTTP Expires header to a date far in the future. You don't need
      to worry about clearing the cached assets when you deploy a new release,
      because Rails will write out the asset's modification time as part of the URL,
      causing browsers to fetch a fresh copy of the asset.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're using an <b>Nginx</b> webserver, add the following snippet to the
      <br /><tt>server { ... }</tt> block for your application:
    </p>

    <pre>
location ~ ^/assets/ {
  passenger_enabled on;
  expires max;
}</pre>

    <p>
      If you're using <b>Apache</b>, make sure that
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_expires.html">mod_expires</a>
      is enabled, and then add the following snippet to the
      appropriate <b>VirtualHost</b> section of your configuration,
      filling in the path to your deployed application:
    </p>

    <pre>
ExpiresActive On
&lt;Directory "/path/to/public/assets"&gt;
  ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      If for any reason (multiple physical servers, rsync-only deploys) you don't
      wish to rely on modification times for cache expiry, Jammit uses the
      standard Rails helpers to generate URLs, and will respect
      the <tt>RAILS_ASSET_ID</tt> environment variable.
    </p>

    <h2 id="embedding">Embedding Images ...</h2>

    <p>
      After you've finished concatenating and compressing your JavaScript and
      CSS files into streamlined downloads, the slowest part of your page load
      is probably the images. It's common to use image sprites to avoid the
      avalanche of HTTP requests that are needed to load a bunch of small images.
      Unfortunately, image sprites can be complicated to position (especially
      with horizontal and vertical tiling), and a real pain to create and
      maintain. With a little elbow grease from Jammit, your spriting woes can be a
      thing of the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      With <b>embed_assets</b> turned on, Jammit will inline image files directly
      into your compiled CSS, using
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">Data-URIs</a> in
      supported browsers, and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mhtml">MHTML</a> in Internet Explorer 7 and below.
      Instead of ten CSS files referencing 30 images, you can have a single,
      packaged, minified, gzipped CSS file, with the images coming in all at
      once instead of piecemeal, making just a single HTTP request.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a look at this example (especially on a slow connection or wifi):<br />
      <a href="http://jashkenas.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/jammit_example/normal.html">Normal Image Loading</a> vs.
      <a href="http://jashkenas.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/jammit_example/jammit.html">Jammit Image Embedding</a><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Embedded images can be a little tricky, which is why using them is strictly
      on an opt-in basis. After enabling <b>embed_assets</b> in the configuration file,
      you'll need to whitelist the images that you'd like to make embeddable.
      When processing CSS, Jammit will only embed images that have
      <b>.../embed/...</b> somewhere in their path &mdash; the other images will be
      left untouched. You can make a single <b>public/images/embed</b> folder for
      your embedded images, or organize them into directories however you
      prefer. It's not recommended to embed all of your site's images, just
      the ones that conform to the following three rules:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Images that are small.</b> Large images will simply delay the rendering
        of your CSS. Jammit won't embed images larger than <b>32 kilobytes</b>, because
        Internet Explorer 8 won't render them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Images that are immediately visible.</b> It's better to leave the
        images that are hidden at page load time to download in the background.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Images that are referenced by a single CSS rule.</b> Referencing the
        same embedded image in multiple rules will cause that image's contents to be
        embedded more than once, defeating the purpose. Replace the duplicated
        rules with an image-specific HTML class, and you're good to go.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      A final <b>cautionary note</b>. Internet Explorer's implementation of MHTML
      requires the use of absolute paths in image references. This means that
      the timestamp that Rails appends to the stylesheet URL (to allow
      far-future expires headers) needs to also be in the contents of the
      stylesheet. If a process on your webserver changes the modification time
      of the cached MHTML stylesheet, it will break the image references. To fix
      it, use the <tt>jammit</tt> command (with <tt>--base-url</tt>) to rebuild your assets, or simply delete
      the cached file, and let Jammit automatically rebuild the file on the next
      request.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the MHTML stylesheets sound too fragile, or if you encounter any problems
      with them in Internet Explorer (such as mixed-mode warnings when serving
      MHTML through SSL), we recommend setting <b>embed_assets</b> to "<b>datauri</b>".
      Using "<b>datauri</b>" will cause Internet Explorer 7 and below to receive
      plain versions of the packaged stylesheets, while all other browsers get the
      Data-URI flavor.
    </p>

    <h3>... and Embedding Fonts</h3>

    <p>
      Embedded fonts work in largely the same way as images, <b>TTF</b> and <b>OTF</b> files
      that are whitelisted within an "embed" folder will be inlined as Data-URIs.
      There is no MHTML variant for fonts, because Internet Explorer only supports
      unembeddable <b>EOT</b> files. Embedding is especially important
      for fonts in general, because it helps avoid
      <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/">the flash of unstyled text</a>
      that the browser would otherwise display while waiting for the font to
      download. If you're looking to get started with web fonts,
      <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator">FontSquirrel has a great tool</a>
      that can generate the proper fonts and styles you'll need. Here's an example
      of a CSS rule that would activate the proper Jammit embedding:
    </p>

<pre>
@font-face {
  font-family: 'DroidSans';
  src: url(/fonts/DroidSans.eot);
  src: local('Droid Sans'), local('DroidSans'), url(/fonts/embed/DroidSans.ttf) format('truetype');
}</pre>

    <h2 id="jst">JavaScript Templates</h2>

    <p>
      If you're using enough JavaScript to want it compressed and concatenated,
      you're probably using it to generate at least a little of your
      HTML. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by joining together strings
      and inserting them into the DOM. A far more agreeable way to generate HTML
      on the client is to use JavaScript templates (referred to here as <b>JST</b>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Jammit helps keep your JavaScript views organized alongside your Rails
      views, bundling them together into packages, and providing them pre-compiled
      for your client-side code to evaluate. If left unspecified, Jammit uses a variant of
      <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/">John Resig's Micro Templating</a>
      to compile the templates, but you can choose your preferred JavaScript templating engine
      of your choosing by setting the <b>template_function</b> in <b>assets.yml</b>.
      Jammit will run all of your templates through the function, and assign
      each one by filename to a top-level <b>JST</b> object. For example, the following
      template, <b>app/views/drivers/license.jst</b>:
    </p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="drivers-license"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Name: &lt;%= name %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Hometown: &lt;%= birthplace %&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;div class="biography"&gt;
    &lt;%= bio %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      Including this template within a JavaScript asset package makes it
      available within the browser as the <b>JST.license</b> function.
    </p>

<pre>
JST.license({name : "Moe", birthplace : "Brooklyn", bio : "Moe was always..."});</pre>
    
    <p>
      Since <b>0.5.0</b>, templates should be included in the appropriate
      <tt>javascripts</tt> package. Here's an example of an <tt>assets.yml</tt>
      that uses templates, and shows the location at which they'll be available
      on the client. When including templates from different directories, the
      common prefix is ignored, and the rest of the path becomes the name of the
      template:
    </p>

<pre>
javascripts:
  workspace:
    - app/views/accounts/badge.jst
    - app/views/common/dialog.jst
    - app/views/common/menu.jst</pre>

    <p>
      Then, from your JavaScript:
    </p>

<pre>
JST['accounts/badge']
JST['common/dialog']
JST['common/menu']</pre>

    <p>
      To use <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore.js</a>
      templates, set <b>template_function</b> to <tt>_.template</tt>.<br />
      To use <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> templates, set
      it to <tt>new Template</tt>.<br />To use
      <a href="http://github.com/janl/mustache.js">Mustache.js</a> templates,
      you'll need
      <a href="http://gist.github.com/234982">a little extra setup</a>.<br />
      If you'd rather leave your template strings as strings, and compile them later,
      set <b>template_function</b> to <tt>off</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default extension for template files is <tt>jst</tt>,
      but you can set <b>template_extension</b> in your <tt>assets.yml</tt> if you're
      using an engine with a preferred extension, such as <tt>html.mustache</tt>
    </p>

      <b class="header">0.5.0</b><br />
      The Jammit gem is now compatible with Rails 3. JST template packages are
      no longer specified separately. This is a backwards-incompatible change,
      and you'll have to update your <tt>assets.yml</tt> file to simply include
      the JST in your existing JavaScript packages, as shown above. Alongside
      this change, template names are now better namespaced &mdash; see the
      section on <b>JavaScript Templates</b> for the details.
      Bugfix for IE8 and Data-URIs slightly under 32kb in size, as well as
      for MHTML in IE7-mode in Vista.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.4.4</b><br />
      Jammit will now add the <tt>RAILS_ASSET_ID</tt> timestamp to image URLs
      within your CSS packages, if configured, for better cache-busting.
      <a href="http://github.com/ghazel/">Greg Hazel</a> contributed a series
      of Jammit/Windows bug fixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.4.3</b><br />
      Bugfix for building on Windows with drive-letter absolute paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.4.2</b><br />
      Added a logged warning when you have rules in <b>assets.yml</b> that don't
      match any files.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.4.1</b><br />
      Jammit is now able to embed <tt>@font-face</tt> web fonts in <b>TTF</b> and
      <b>OTF</b> formats. The <b>embed_images</b> option has been renamed to
      <b>embed_assets</b> for this change. The <b>assets.yml</b> file is now
      passed through ERB before being loaded, so you can configure
      environment-specific settings, just like you would with <b>database.yml</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.3.3</b><br />
      Added <tt>css_compressor_options</tt> to assets.yml, so you can
      set <tt>charset</tt> and <tt>line_break</tt> for the YUI CSS Compressor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.3.2</b><br />
      If Java isn't available on your machine, Jammit will now run in a graceful
      degraded mode, where assets are packaged but not compressed. You can now
      pass <tt>:embed_assets => false</tt> to the <tt>include_stylesheets</tt>
      helper to disable image embedding on a per-package basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.8</b><br />
      Jammit now correctly rewrites relative image URLs within CSS, for easier
      integration with partial Rails apps deployed on sub-paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.7</b><br />
      The <tt>jammit</tt> command has been enhanced to check the modification times of
      your packages &mdash; if no source files have changed, the package isn't
      rebuilt.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.6</b><br />
      Jammit now raises an exception if Java isn't installed, or if the Java
      version is unsupported by your JavaScript compressor of choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.5</b><br />
      When specifying your asset packages as directory globs, absolute globs are
      now absolute, and relative globs are relative to RAILS_ROOT.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.4</b><br />
      Jammit now throws a <tt>ConfigurationNotFound</tt> error when attempting to load
      a nonexistent configuration file. Resolved an issue with asset caching from
      daemonized mongrels.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.1</b><br />
      The <tt>include_stylesheets</tt> helper now takes the same options as the
      Rails <tt>stylesheet_link_tag</tt> helper (such as <tt>:media => 'print'</tt>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.2.0</b><br />
      Jammit now supports the <b>Google Closure Compiler</b> as an alternative
      to the YUI compressor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.1.3</b><br />
      Fixed a bug that conflicted with other plugins trying to alter
      ApplicationController in development.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b class="header">0.1.1</b><br />
      Added support for embedding images with stylesheet-relative paths.
      Shortened the MHTML identifiers.
    </p>
